# PBR-Maps-Generator
Helps generate PBR maps from a base/diffuse map depending on the workflow chosen. This project demonstrates the power of Unity 6's WebGPU backend by implementing a Physically Based Rendering (PBR) map generator that runs efficiently in web browsers. It showcases the use of compute shaders for GPU-accelerated texture processing, providing a significant performance boost over traditional CPU-based methods.
